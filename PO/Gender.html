                    <li><span>Cisgender= <br> An individual that identifies like the gender they were assigned at birth.<br> AMAB is the abbreviation of Assigned Male At Birth and AFAB is <br> the abbreviation of Assigned Female At Birth. Cisgender people are <br> also not included in the LGBTQIA+ community. But someone could be <br> cis and have a different sexuality then hetero ofcourse. </span></li>

                    <li><span>Genderfluid= <br> A genderidentity that refers to a gender that differs from time to <br> time. It refers to someone that doesn't have a fixed gender. How you <br> feel depends per person, some feel very feminine, some more masculine,<br> some  feel like both genders at once and other feels feel like neither.<br> But it varries per person and time. </span></li>

                    <li><span>Genderqueer= <br> Is the umbrella term for people that feel that their gender is different <br> from their gender assigned at birth. It is similar to  Non binary <br> and could be used for people that do drag. but also just for anyone <br>  that feels midway gender or 75% one gender.</span></li>                      <br>

                    <li><span>Intersex= <br> is an individual that has the physical characteristics of the <br> intermediate of a woman and a man. that can happen because of extra <br> or different chromosomes or something with hormone levels during<br>  the pregnancy. They themselves can also idntify as any of the gender <br> but offcially they would be intersex ofcourse.</span></li>      
                        <img class="flagzInter" src="images/intersex.jpg" alt="Intersex flag" />
                    <li><span>Non-binary= <br> Is first of all also the umbrella term for people that feel that their <br> gender is different from what they were assigned at birth, just like <br>  Genderqueer. There are many labels under the umbrella like Genderfluid. <br> Not only is Non-Binary an umbrella term though, come some also just <br> use this  as their label. Non-binary also has an abbreviation Enby, but <br> not everyone likes that one so be sure to first ask that person.  </span></li>             <br>

                    <li><span>Transgender= <br> A Transgender is someone that identifies as the opposite gender they <br> w>ere assigned at birth. So an AMAB person would feel like a woman, <br>  then they would be MTF, Male To Female. And an AFAB person would feel <br>  like a man, then they would be FTM, Female To Male. And the <br> abbreviation  of Transgender is Trans.</span></li>                      <br>
